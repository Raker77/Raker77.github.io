<h1>How many save files can you have on Castlevania: Symphony of the night?</h1>
<p>pleasingly, a lot.</p>
<h2>answer</h2>
<p>15 saves per memory card. SCPH-1020 has 16 blocks, 15 avialable to users, and each sotn file is one block. 1 megabit (128 kB) cards, etc. </p>

<img src="sotn-1/savescreensotn.jpg" alt="the save menu from Castlevania: Symphony of the night. athe the top of the screen it says 'File copy' in a fancy font. its surrounded by curvy lines, and the F in File is a drop cap Initial. there are 4 fancy bordered boxes (same fancy as the the 'file copy') in the middle in a plus shape. the left box says Card with a 1 behind it. inside is 15 side facing human skulls, each one is a save file. on the right side box, it says Card with a 2 behind it. since a second memory card was not inserted, inside the box says NO CARD. the top box says Name:A Place:Enterance below that in the box it says lv 2 TIME: 0:08:23 $0 3.2%  below the top box is a golden arrow and the bottom box. the bottom box says the same thing as the top box, as in the copy menu, a save is in progress, indicating that a slot data is being replicated to another. I hope this alt text is suitable and not too long..." style="width:1280px;height:960px;">
