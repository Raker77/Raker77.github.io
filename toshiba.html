<h1>Stubborn broken toshibas.</h1>
<p>So, assuming you have a toshiba PDR-5 in the first place and also not a PDR-M5, then get an CR-123a and put it in the camera. the button of the battery will <br> 
rest on the bump of the battery cover.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>so your camera has a battery and you've pulled the power switch, but all you get is a red light. the screen displays nothing and pressing the shutter button provides<br>
well, game over. but not really. <br>
I'm not entirely sure if the screen is meant to not be very visible, but it will likely be displaying something still. It seems to be a non backlit Twisted Nematic <br>
so you probably won't see much without direct light, and on these old toshibas, probably need a flashlight directly pointed at it. Set your camera to 'play' and <br>
if the LED turns from red to orange/amber, then you're in luck. take a look at the screen and it will either say 'no card' (insert your Smart Media card, or insert it<br>
the right way (they are not keyed/the slot is not keyed)), 'no image' (grats, the camera detects a memory card (max 16 MB, fat 12 format)) or you'll see your photos.<br>
</p>
<h2>The Other problem</h2>
<p>if you set it back to 'record' you'll notice that the LED turns back to red. and if yours is in the same condition as mine, it will stay red. <br>
on the front of the camera by the lens is the macro/normal switch. with set to 'record' move the front switch to macro, wait, then move it back to normal. <br>
if yours is like mine, the LED turns to orange. line up a photo, and press the shutter button. if the flash still works, it'll go off and take a picture. TADA!<br>
its worth noting that the Red LED is also a flash charging light. if orange and you take a photo, it goes red, blinks, and goes orange.<br>
I'm not sure if mine not responding until switching from macro and back is normal or not, but surely not.</p>
<h2> notes</h2>
<p>sometimes the screen might actively display what the lens sees. I'm not sure how to get that to happen. one of the small round buttons activates this I think <br>
expect lots of ghosting on that display.<br>
often, the openable back/PC Card interface is broken and the plastic is cracked. I believe mine has done so and now the buttons on the same face as the screen don't work <br>
especially the d-pad. this means that you cannot adjust the settings in the setting menu nor scroll to view other photos on 'play' mode.<br>
if you somehow have a working PC Card back thing, and put it through an adaptor slot on a PC, it won't work without the drivers probably. no one has put the driver online yet <br>
but I think I might have the opportunity to get it and do so.<br>
sometimes you might get a PDR-5 without the wrist strap. GET A WRIST STRAP. the plastic has not aged well on these and the plastics are very creaky on mine. <br>
these are coming up to be 28b years old in a few months as of writing, so it will only worsen from here. one day they will all fall apart in hand. <br>
if you're looking for replacment straps, get one of those third party Wii gamepad straps. they work nice and are cheap and good quality. <br>
the purpose of a wrist strap is to prevent drops to the camera, but in this case doubly so. drop them and you may damage electronics, but almost definitely crack apart<br>
 the now brittle plastics.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>uh, I dunno. hope this helped. I got mine as broken for about 10 USD but it ust needed a battery and me to figure out what exactly was going on, <br>
that I have now written down because I needed this info back when I first got it.</p>
