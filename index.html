<h3>The New Flash Editor ""Flit"" and rambings about flash.</h3>
<p>So. adobe flash is dead. Or is it really? No. It would seem that adobe has killed off future  development on their end (unless you count handing AIR to HARMAN, or them being forced to update
the player even still in china, (see also clean flash for china players beyond 32)). But that hasn't really seemed to stop anyone! Recently, as in within the past 4 years now, whos counting anyway,
I was made aware of Ruffle flash player, Lightspark flash player, and a few others I don't particularly have interest in mentioning. (aye, had they not given up.) It seems that you can have your
cake again with Ruffle especially, as its all new code for a new age, rather than the past 15 years of tacking on fixes like the ol adobe players. anyway, lightspark is ancient and good enough for
that as well, but let me incoherently ramble on.
Well alright then, smart ass, so  you can play old hat again with yer modern players! that don't mean very much for the creation of NEW files, then? well, you're right.
these players were never made with that in mind. so, what's an old coder meant to do? someone with compassion still in their heart for flash in this blasted age?
well, it seems that the old versions of flash pro 8 up to cs6 (cs5.5) are floating around the pirate world, but thats old and creaky on new hardware.</p>
<h3>The new Flash *editors*</h3>
<p>alright. thats enough 'padding'. You've got 2 options for making flash files now (yes, I am ignoring the flashpunks/flashdevelops, because that's half in the ground as it is. Bite me.)</p>
<h4> JPEXS's FFDEC</h4>
<p>so lately, as of may '23 FFDEC can create new empty SWFs for you, and they've had an Actionscript editor in there since the start, so if you know raw code, type away then inject image data, etc etc
using the existing ffdec tooling. </p>
<h4> flits editor</h4>
<p> right. so it seems that a who I think is a bloke, named jonathan or thisisjonathan has created a seemingly wholely new editor. flits editor, or what I like to refer to as 'Flit's' is a very basic
editor that can make a swf file, by the barest definition. its more of an assembly tool, you'll be having none of art creation within the editor, you must be putting your assets in your file manager
of choice in the right location, then open the editor and make your sandwich that way. I've not found it intuitive at all, but really, its not right to be harsh! what appears to be one person, and I
assume and hope without any 'robotic assistance', lets say, has done ass this themself and it works to boot! anybody else stopped their SWF ceation tools ages ago and most others never got this far!
their first release on github was around the day of October 12th '24, and the response of their announcement on the ruffle (discord) forum was muted, from my perspective. oughtta have a bigger blast,
but hey. the flash community has been burned, burned, burned and burnt. so many. times. and ol jonathan did quite a lot of emote reations, so there's hope. of course, this is december now, and
there's not been any peep or code updates since that october day. I hope they continue it. be a shame to see it go like all the rest. thank you jonathan, for a better stab than most.</p>
