<h3>(make your stuff more self contained!)</h3>
<hr>
<h3>The problem with multiple files</h3>
<p>We all know the deal. when making something with a lot of parts, keep those parts in seperate files so you can swap one in and take the old one out without needing to recompile your entire
program. Better for maintainability, better for updating small portions instead of whole programs, etc etc. Fast forward 20 years. how much of that program is even usable if just one of those
files are gone? In my experience, if one file is missing, at best you're looking at chunks of content missing. at worst, the whole program will *never* run again. and if it does, its
missing what you came there for, so replacing the missing thing with a dummy just to get it to run isn't helpful.</p>
<h4>dogmatic design doesn't help, actually</h4>
<p> in the modern *and* old world, you'll have people obssess about how their language is better than the other, their UI design language is best, no matter what anyone thinks, or what it
does to usability,the structure of their file system, their structure of internal formats for a program, how low or high their memory or code is. in most of these cases, the world moves
on as the designers or tenants of the faith hold ever tighter and grow bitter at better or even sidegrade solutions. different philosiphies get ignored because "I've been using
[y programming language] for 30 years! and the new way I've barely learned in comparison is STUPID"</p>
<h4> what does this have to do with multiple files?</h4>
<p>it only has a passing resembelance ;P</p>
<hr>
<h4>this is only going to get worse.</h4>
<p>often when I download things, I'm wary of what's missing. and like the capacitor plague, the 'missing bits plague' is just horrid after a certain time period. old adobe flash installers?
missing all the documentation and demos. wiki, date, and help files from certain programs? internet download from long dead servers and forums. complex for its time, impressive 3d flash programs?
shattered into peices when built and half those peices were never archived. music from your favourite artist, who had videos on their site that you can just download? those videos were from
a video sharing website or used a yotube like solution and now you have only the embedded player but no video. a game you used to play? the XML data it pulled and had seperate for ease of
translation is now the only thing that no longer exists, making the game wait forever as it thinks it just needs to download. a mobile app you liked? sorry. it was just a webpage in a wrapper.
good luck ever finding it. early 'HTML5' game? sorry, no images were saved and the game needed that so you could see your character. online game? you just had a client, all assets were on the
server and no one got any of it before it went.<p>
<h3>this is gonna be even more fun in the future when no one has a PC they own/no one has a PC that isn't a streaming terminal/all the games are online only and you have no disc+ no installed
data</h3>
<hr>
<p>the worst ones I see very often are the only copy of the dead/long missing musician's music that was hosted on their blog is now gone, the 'game split into 5000 bits and you're missing one or more bits",
and the 'program you installed is now esoteric and the only way you could ever have learned how to use it or how to get good at it was the help docs that weren't included by default. its
a shame really. it might've taken more bandwith or time to download back then, but now you are paying the price. better yet if the bloody thing was never open source, so in the off chance
*you're* the one with the last copy in the whole world that's complete, you can't share it without being sued or being forced to take it down before it has re-spread enough. </p>
<h4>in many cases (yeah, yeah, not all etc etc) the only the other file aside from your program that should exist, is things that are created from using it, ie save data, documents, or 
other such data.</h4>
<p>if your program cannot be used long after you have created it, long after you stop supporting it,even long after you don't even host a download or install media for it, you have *failed*
as a designer. except of course if you're mad enough to be designing it to expire, art nonwithstanding. there will be times where the new update you made isn't popular, and the old version
is more ideal. making it impossible to use <b>BY INTENTION OR NOT</b> will NOT 'make' people buy the new version/update. you will just lose money. you will lose market share. and you
will lose trust. of course those only matter to a corporation, minus trust. if you're an indie or open source developer and you think splitting your program into parts is a good idea,
generally you should be ashamed, but its not like this line of text will make you feel that way, but you should also look ahead. Do you want people to not only look back, but also *reach back*
and appreciate your work, use your utility when they need it, or even be able to prove it ever existed at all?
<h4> keep in mind, I mean parts that can be
*lost*. I'm not saying making a monolith is easier. just don't make part 1, part 2 and the help docs seperate downloads or even seperate files in a folder.</h4>
<hr>
<h3>sometimes it is impossible to make a 'one file' program</h3>
<p>need to make a program related to video encoding/decoding/creation? yeah, its not gonna be easy to make a uni file program. the terms of the usage of the codec are evil (like most are)</p>
distributing it in this way could get you sued. I get it. But you *can* make a minimum. bake in the videos, help documentation, and language data. Don't sit and hotfix something that wasn't
ready to go out. if applicatble, I know. contracts, licences and crunch/unholy and inpossible deadlines makes things and life hard and hell. </p>
<h4>just keep in mind, any file including the binary itself has an opportunity to be lost. Don't make it worse.</h4>
<p>it does <b>NOT</b> matter if its just an xml, or boilerplate unit, or even a font. the more you have, the more risk you take on. and when those risks do not pay off, you had better
hope it was just the font missing. (unless of course, the font was what people in the future were looking for!)</p>
<p>the more self contained your program is, the more likely it will still actually function, be usable or learnable, or have all the assets that it had originally to make it tick.</p>
<hr>
<h3>um achually, evern self contained or uni file programs become lost media all the time too</h3>
<p>You're right!   however, if you had the choice between <i>"at worst, the program is lost/corrupted entirely. at best, the program will never function or have the data you're looking for"</i> OR <i>"at worst,
the program is lost/corrupted entirely. at best, there is a few copies left that while scarce(yes!), work and exist entirely"</i></p>
<p>while NEITHER ARE VERY IDEAL <sub>AT ALL</sub> , I know which I would much rather prefer!</p>
<h2> in conclusion, I don't know. I just would like to have programs that are interesting that also will function and have all the same features whenever I look.<h2>

<h3>The New Flash Editor ""Flit"" and rambings about flash.</h3>
<p>--_</p>
<p>So. adobe flash is dead. Or is it really? No. It would seem that adobe has killed off future  development on their end (unless you count handing AIR to HARMAN, or them being forced to update
the player even still in china, (see also clean flash for china players beyond 32)). But that hasn't really seemed to stop anyone! Recently, as in within the past 4 years now, whos counting anyway,
I was made aware of Ruffle flash player, Lightspark flash player, and a few others I don't particularly have interest in mentioning. (aye, had they not given up.) It seems that you can have your
cake again with Ruffle especially, as its all new code for a new age, rather than the past 15 years of tacking on fixes like the ol adobe players. anyway, lightspark is ancient and good enough for
that as well, but let me incoherently ramble on.
Well alright then, smart ass, so  you can play old hat again with yer modern players! that don't mean very much for the creation of NEW files, then? well, you're right.
these players were never made with that in mind. so, what's an old coder meant to do? someone with compassion still in their heart for flash in this blasted age?
well, it seems that the old versions of flash pro 8 up to cs6 (cs5.5) are floating around the pirate world, but thats old and creaky on new hardware.</p>
<h3>The new Flash *editors*</h3>
<p>--_</p>
<p>alright. thats enough 'padding'. You've got 2 options for making flash files now (yes, I am ignoring the flashpunks/flashdevelops, because that's half in the ground as it is. Bite me.)</p>
<h4> JPEXS's FFDEC</h4>
<p>so lately, as of may '23 FFDEC can create new empty SWFs for you, and they've had an Actionscript editor in there since the start, so if you know raw code, type away then inject image data, etc etc
using the existing ffdec tooling. JPEXS themself has been a master genius of all things decompilation, and of flash in general. I am very thankful for their efforts and cannot stress their importance
enough. There's also the recent ish addition of the simple editor mode that seems not very good at this time, but bears a certain resembelence to flash editors of old's interface. </p>
<h4> flits editor</h4>
<p>--_</p>
<p> right. so it seems that a who I think is a bloke, named jonathan or thisisjonathan has created a seemingly wholely new editor. flits editor, or what I like to refer to as 'Flit's' is a very basic
editor that can make a swf file, by the barest definition. its more of an assembly tool, you'll be having none of art creation within the editor, you must be putting your assets in your file manager
of choice in the right location, then open the editor and make your sandwich that way. I've not found it intuitive at all, but really, its not right to be harsh! what appears to be one person, and I
assume and hope without any 'robotic assistance', lets say, has done ass this themself and it works to boot! anybody else stopped their SWF ceation tools ages ago and most others never got this far!
their first release on github was around the day of October 12th '24, and the response of their announcement on the ruffle (discord) forum was muted, from my perspective. oughtta have a bigger blast,
but hey. the flash community has been burned, burned, burned and burnt. so many. times. and ol jonathan did quite a lot of emote reations, so there's hope. of course, this is december now, and
there's not been any peep or code updates since that october day. I hope they continue it. be a shame to see it go like all the rest. thank you jonathan, for a better stab than most.</p>
<h4>tutorial on how to use Flit's</h4>
<p>--_</p>
<h5>step one, get your hands on the preview build/pre release version of the software.</h5>
<p>this is easy enough, provided you're here in the past. future people may have trouble finding it if its taken down, abandoned or lost in 50 years. there's a windows build and a linux build. and
yer source codes, etc.</p>
<h5>step two, extract the zip if you've got that version</h5>
<p> no compilation tutorial here I'm afraid. none provided on the repo(might be one but I couldn't be arsed to find it) I've chosen the linux build because windows past 10 is such a pain, and you could argue 10 was too, but I won't. inside the zip is all your licences,
ruffle(!), mtasc(!) and the other third parties licensed under apache. and of course the binary.</p>
<h5>step three</h5>
<p>after opening the program, you'll see new project, load project, and about. about just states a few times that it is the flits editor, and that its a prerelease version. I imagine that proper versioning
schemes will come with final releases. hopefully you'll see more than the old adobe players would say. ideally we'll see dates, changelogs, and maybe a thanks page.
pressing load project won't do much if you're just starting out, but maybe in the future when this will have been out for a few years, you'll be able to come across existing project files to load, but I'm
here in '24 and I only know of 3 for sure: n0samu's, as they were testing it at some point after release, jonathan's, as there's a screenshot on the ruffle discord, and mine, after I figured it out and
felt the need to document how I managed here. maybe some of the big ruffle maintainers have given it a shot. *wink*

pressing new project takes you to step 4 </p>
<h5>step four</h5>
<p>before you're loaded to a new file, you need to select a directory where all the upcoming flash data will be stored. I reccomend you making a new folder somewhere so as to not lose your flit projects
among other files. keepin mind that each new project will need its own folder, as when creating the structure, flit's will make an assets folder, the, src folder, and the """FLAs""" (more on that later).
just make a flit's folder, then a subfolder for every new project.
anyway, width of the stage is set to 640 and height to  360 by default. framerate at 60. in comparison to flash cs5 and cs6 which set to 550 by 400 at 24fps. unique? maybe. it could be that adobe animate
(post cs6, rip CS) has different defaults for no reason, or maybe the defaults are set to an older version of flash pro's defaults, I'm not sure atm. the editor does warn you when you make a new project
in a non empty directory. </p>
<h5>step five</h5>
<p>when the new project opens, stage on the left, library on the right, and properties at the bottom. (theming is the same as Ruffle, egui.) at the top, file, view,control, edit, help. Pro tip: use your file manager to navigate to *your
custom directory* > *the movie you want to edit* > assets. put all your images, (I assume actionscript code files(as2 only)) and I assume sfx there BEFORE making any new movieclips. else you'll get
mysterious errors that prevent exports or saving.
really simple, make a new movieclip in the library, add an image from the right side where you'll see your assets, and navigate back to the main stage/scene, drag and drop the new library entry, and
there you go, a simple movie/SWF.
export from 'file' at the top or 'ctrl + E' and you'll then not get any notification it has exported. remember to save.
the SWF'll be in your assets folder roundabouts.  </p>
<h5>you did it!</h5>
<p>--_</p>
<h4>misc</h4>
<p>the resulting SWF is decently slim. a bit slimmer  than the same swf made in CS5 more or less. might change if you have move than 1 image in a movieclip in your SWF, but hey. made  a somewhat
identical SWF on CS5 and it was bigger. flits swfs seem to use ZLIB compression, unlike most very early swfs (CS5 uses zlib by default too) do. flits SWFs use AS2 at SWF 43, which I don't think you
can usually get away with on adobe's. (CS5 has as2 at SWF 11)
These basic SWFs will run just fine in nearly any flash projector. most of what you can do on FLITS is as2 and very simple, adobe flash player 9 can run it fine, but so does flash player 32,
which I imagine 32 was the targeted version. as I assume jon used adobe animate and ruffle as a reference. as for the ""FLAs"", they seem to be just json files. hmm. I'm not sure how to feel about that.
I'd prefer them to be real flas for real compatability, but then again old format flas were insane and only jpexs knows how to really parse them, new format flas are better and easier, but json is more
recognizable in comparison. good for readability, bad for cross compat I suppose?</p>
<h2> That's all for now. thanks to jon for being cool enough to make an editor.</h2>
