<!--bg stuff 1 part CSS 1 part JS. body is default page .dark-mode is what it'll turn into on button press
  the flash embed is just a pretty box since modern browsers are stupid and hide swf embeds completely so the page layout warps in response as if it were not there.
  the notebox style is just. semi-suffering. so the textbox can be in view while playing without scrolling down as much-->

<h1>How do I 'forget' a device on KDEConnect?</h1>
<p>You don't. At least, not as easily as pressing a 'foget device' button...</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Disconnect from the device.</li>
  <li> To use items in your inventory, click on the item and click on what you would like to use it on.</li>
  <li> To fast forward time, click on the clock.</li>
  <li> To revert to previous hours, open the logbook and click the log header.</li>
  <li> Make sure to read your logbook to keep track of your current goals, and for hints on your performance.</li>
  <li> This game autosaves your progress.</li>
</ul>

<!-- the single JS for the Light/dark mode. a necessary evil.-->

}

<!--if you're not using JS while surfing the web, same here. I do my best to avoid bloating the site. everything can be read and played with if JS is off,
  if you use the ruffle extension, it injects some JS I think so you'll need it on if you're trying to play the swfs here on a modern browser.-->
