<h2>Random Flash tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>your minimum stage size should be 215 x 138 pixels. this is the size used by many of flash's dialog boxes. like camera requests and storage requests. if its smaller, the docs say the request will fail.</li>
<li>try and make your stage match a popular aspect ratio, like 4:3 and 16:9. you can do the math like this: decide your height (ie 720) and do 4 / 3 X 720 (= 960) so 960 is your width and 720 is your height.
the smaller number should always be the height. (16:9 is 16 / 9 x 720 = 1280 ) </li>

<p>when there is a decimal or fraction, its best to round up to the nearest pixel. (ie 853.33333333 should become 854.) this does mess up the ratio, but is close enough that it will
work for screen and resolution purposes. It may be impossible to find fractions of pixels implemented in any display.</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>4:3 is standard. Also known as 'SD aspect' 'Fullscreen' '1.33.1'. It once was the aspect ratio for most media, computer screens, video games, and more. It was originally used on 3.5mm silent films. </li>
    <li>16:9 is wide. Also known as 'widescreen' '1.77.1'. It is similar to 4:3 but with a extended width. Common since 2009-2010. </li>
    <li>3:2 doesn't really have a 'screen' name. its a photography size. some computer screens were 3:2. GBAs are 3:2.</li>
    <li>5:4 doesn't really have a 'screen' name. its a photography size. some computer screens that claim to be 4:3 are actualy 5:4. may have been used in early TV. used on early Computer monitors.</li>
    <li>1:1 doesn't really have a 'screen' name. its a photography size. people like square pictures. kodak and polaroid. some displays are 1:1. some games like steamlands are 1:1.</li>
