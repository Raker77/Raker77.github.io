<h2>Random Flash tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>your minimum stage size should be 215 x 138 pixels. this is the size used by many of flash's dialog boxes. like camera requests and storage requests. if its smaller, the docs say the request will fail.</li>
<li>try and make your stage match a popular aspect ratio, like 4:3 and 16:9. you can do the math like this: decide your height (ie 720) and do 4 / 3 X 720 (= 960) so 960 is your width and 720 is your height.
the smaller number should always be the height. (16:9 is 16 / 9 x 720 = 1280 ) </li>
<li>Embed your font into your swf. in 20 years when adobe kills off flash, you'll want your SWF to be self contained and not be missing fonts or use fonts you didn't intend.</li>

<p>when there is a decimal or fraction, its best to round up to the nearest pixel. (ie 853.33333333 should become 854.) this does mess up the ratio, but is close enough that it will
work for screen and resolution purposes. It may be impossible to find fractions of pixels implemented in any display.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>4:3 is standard. Also known as 'SD aspect' 'Fullscreen' '1.33.1'. It once was the aspect ratio for most media, computer screens, video games, and more. It was originally used on 3.5mm silent films. </li>
    <li>16:9 is wide. Also known as 'widescreen' '1.77.1'. It is similar to 4:3 but with a extended width. Common since 2009-2010. </li>
    <li>3:2 doesn't really have a 'screen' name. its a photography size. some computer screens were 3:2. GBAs are 3:2.</li>
    <li>5:4 doesn't really have a 'screen' name. its a photography size. some computer screens that claim to be 4:3 are actualy 5:4. may have been used in early TV. used on early Computer monitors.</li>
    <li>1:1 doesn't really have a 'screen' name. its a photography size. people like square pictures. kodak and polaroid. some displays are 1:1. some games like steamlands are 1:1.</li>

<h1>Embedding Flash onto your webpage/Making a flash embed.</h1>

<p>DISCLAIMER:<br> some of the html code I just paste in here will be missing some characters like the greater and less than signs or whatever.<br> I deleted those because
I could not be bothered to escape the characters.<br>
you'll just have to know what blanks to fill in.<br> expecting prior
knowledge kinda sucks, but this never was the best place for a tutorial.<br> nor is it the best tutorial, either. but last I looked, no one else has a tutorial,
<br> this is just one of those things that you were 'expected to just know' in the past. or read the-now-delisted-docs <br> so spreading even the most basic info about 
old flash knowledge that<br>
was taken for granted, justifies it enough, I suppose.</p>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<h3>have an html page to put this on.</h3>
<p>so, you want to make your page have flash content? good choice. lets assume you have a blank html page.<br> and we'll assume you know how to make a basic html 
page.</p> 
<p>or just copy what you see here and fill in the meta fields to fit your custom case.</p>

<img src="images/code1.jpg" alt="a text editor with some code. the code has a doctype, html, head and meta blocks. the meta blocks are inside the head block and 
before the 
body block where some header text and paragraph text blocks are. there is not much to the html page currently and no flash embed is there."
style= "width:612px;height:293px;">

<p>the basic page</p>
<div style="background-color:#ccffcc;">
<p><pre>
!DOCTYPE html
html lang="en"
head
title>Page Title title
meta charset= UTF-8
meta name= description content= a webpage with flash content. 
meta name= keywords content= Adobe Flash, flash, ruffle, swf
meta name= author  content= your name, etc 
meta name= viewport  content=width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0

head
body

h1 flash game h1
p description of game p

body
html
</pre></p>
</div>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<h3>upload your .SWF to your server.</h3>
<p> simple really, you'll need your swf on your server in order to embed it in a page. to avoid confusion, lets assume its not in any folder.</p>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<h3>on your basic page, within the body, add the embed code.</h3>
<p>the embed code.</p>

<div style="background-color:#ccffcc;">
<p><pre> embed src="game.swf" quality="high" name="game.swf" width="550" height=400" type=application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage=https://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer"
</pre></p>
</div>

<img src="images/code2.jpg" alt="again, a text editor with some code. the code has a doctype, html, head and meta blocks. 
the meta blocks are inside the head block and before the body block where some header text and paragraph text blocks are. there is not much to the html page currently
but the flash embed has been added."
style="width:1165px;height:349px;">

<p>you only really need the embed and the height and width. you can add the rest for funsies or if you have code  that uses the extra fields to apply them
to the swf document.</p>
<h2>Step 4</h2>
<h3>host the page</h3>
<p>however you do it, host the page online or with a localhost.</p>
<h2>Step 5</h2>
<h3>make it pretty (optional)</h3>
<p>modern browers can suck and dont display swf embeds unless you have ruffle or if they do its to tell you
that the plugin needed to see it isn't supported. put a box around the embed to indicate something is there with a div and css</p>

<img src="images/code3.jpg" alt="a white html page is being rendered in a browser. the header and paragraph element are shown and they say 'Flash game' 
and under that 'description of game'. these are placeholders and meant to be replaced by whoever follows this bad tutorial. the rest of the page is blank because
no plugins or extensions that render swf files are installed, and the browser is hiding the embed."
style="width:652px;height:382px;">


<p>the styling.</p>
<div style="background-color:#ccffcc;">
<p><pre>
style
        .flashembed 
           width: 550px
           height 400px
           border solid blue
           border-width 3px
           padding 3px
           margin auto
        
style
</pre></p>
</div>

<img src="images/code2.5.jpg" alt="a text editor with some code. the code has a doctype, html, head and meta blocks. 
the meta blocks are inside the head block and before the body block where some header text and paragraph text blocks are. there is not much to the html page currently
but the flash embed has been added and now has a CSS style for a blue border above the body tag in the head tag."
style="width:796px;height:378px;">

<p>CSS can be funky.</p>
<img src="images/code4.jpg" alt="a white html page is being rendered in a browser. the placeholder header and paragraph element are shown and they say 'Flash game' 
and under that 'description of game'. to the right of that in the middle of the page is a blue hollow border around an empty part of the page. the embed inside the 
blue box is not rendered. "
style="width:721px;height:366px;">

<p>but you can use it (CSS) to do all sorts of things.</p>
<img src="images/code5.jpg" alt="a white html page is being rendered in a browser. the placeholder header and paragraph element are shown and they say 'Flash game' 
and under that 'description of game'. to the right of that is a blue hollow border. the page is rendering a swf file inside. the swf displays black text on a blue
background that is german text from a video game."
style="width:758px;height:395px;">

<p>tada, your embed!</p>
<h2>Step 6</h2>
<h3>done probably</h3>
<p>this makes a very empty very basic page with just some text and the flash embed. <br>To display flash content, you'll need a browser old enough that supports plug-ins
which are a different and older thing than extensions, <br>and get the adobe flash plugin. or you could get the lightspark flash player plug-in.<br> on a browser that does
 not support plug-ins, try getting the Ruffle extension. Ruffle is probably the most compatable open source flash player replacement.<br> also, try and describe what
the game is and what it looks like because flash content isn't always the easiest for text only users. although some old screen readers could tap into some text fields
 on flash files, this was rarely supported by flash developers, regrettably.</p>
