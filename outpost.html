<!--bg stuff 1 part CSS 1 part JS. body is default page .dark-mode is what it'll turn into on button press
  the flash embed is just a pretty box since modern browsers are stupid and hide swf embeds completely so the page layout warps in response as if it were not there.
  the notebox style is just. semi-suffering. so the textbox can be in view while playing without scrolling down as much-->

<!--its a span so we can cut out the nav from the css BG. a div makes a too long cutout and if nothing is cut out then the link text does not contrast
  with the bg colour well and might as well be invisible. which isn't good for navigation-->

<!--a figure should probably not be used here. usually for images, not flash embeds. I used it just so I could have a little caption tied to the same width as the
  embed without doing insane float hand-lineups like the notebox.-->
   <figure>
   <div class ="flashembed">
   <embed src="shoc/outpost-haven-1.3-fixed.swf" tabindex="0" quality="high" name="outpost-haven-1.3-fixed.swf" width="640" height="480" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="https://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer">
   <!--all I  really need is the src and width and height. tabindex is supposed to indicate that the swf is in interactive element, but idk if it really works here. sorry.
   quality is set in the hopes of the swf content using that value to set its quality but might need something else on the page (probably JS) to actually make it work
   name is probably a remenant of this too where it  was used like an ID or class for JS. adding the type here is good. if nothing else, a carving in the stone of the
   webpage that tells ya whats there. pluginspage used to be useful before 2019. not anymore. it just linked you to ad*be to get fp installed if it wasn't. this 
   probably would need more setup here to actually function like that though. is vestigial now. but not even required.
   this embed isn't tied up so if you have a flash browser it'll work as normal there, and if you've got a modern browser, a ruffle extension can polyfill it.
   so works in both generations, which is ideal. could just self host ruffle here but won't work on old browsers so... nope.-->
